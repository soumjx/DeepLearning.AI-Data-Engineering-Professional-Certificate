# Data Engineering Defined — Key Points

## What Data Engineering Is
- Modern data engineering evolved from software engineers who shifted focus from applications to data systems.
- Organizations recognized data as valuable, leading to dedicated roles for handling large volumes and diverse sources.

## Definition (Fundamentals of Data Engineering)
**Data engineering = Developing, implementing, and maintaining systems/processes that convert raw data into high-quality, consistent information for downstream use (analytics, ML).**

## Core Areas Intersecting Data Engineering
- Security  
- Data Management  
- DataOps  
- Data Architecture  
- Orchestration  
- Software Engineering

## Data Engineering Life Cycle — Stages
- **Data Generation & Source Systems**  
- **Ingestion**  
- **Storage**  
- **Transformation**  
- **Serving**

> Storage underpins ingestion, transformation, and serving.

## End Use Cases
- Analytics  
- Machine Learning  
- Reverse ETL (sending processed data back to source systems)

## Data Pipeline (Concept)
- Combined architecture, systems, and processes that move data from generation → ingestion → storage → transformation → serving → use cases.

## Undercurrents (Apply Across All Stages)
- Security  
- Data Management  
- DataOps  
- Data Architecture  
- Orchestration  
- Software Engineering

## Core Responsibility of a Data Engineer
- Acquire raw data  
- Transform it into useful information  
- Serve it to downstream stakeholders

# Data Engineering Defined — Essential Notes

## Evolution of Data Engineering
- Original data engineers were software engineers building software applications.
- Data generated by applications was regarded as a byproduct or exhaust.
- Over time, organizations recognized the intrinsic value of data.
- As volume and variety of data grew, engineers focused on building systems for ingesting, storing, transforming, and serving data.
- The role of data engineer emerged.

## Definition of Data Engineering
**Data engineering is the development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take in raw data and produce high quality, consistent information that supports downstream use cases, such as analysis and machine learning.**

- Data engineering is the intersection of:
  - Security  
  - Data management  
  - DataOps  
  - Data architecture  
  - Orchestration  
  - Software engineering

## Data Engineering Life Cycle
- The life cycle comprises stages.
- Data generation and source systems start the process.
- Middle stages: ingestion, transformation, storage, serving.
- Storage sits underneath ingestion, transformation, and serving, and spans the width of the box.
- Life cycle helps visualize common elements of any data system.
- End use cases: analytics, machine learning, Reverse ETL.

## Data Pipeline
- Data pipeline describes architecture, systems, and processes moving data through the stages of the data engineering life cycle.
- As a data engineer, you manage the life cycle from source systems to serving data for use cases.

## Undercurrents of the Life Cycle
- Six components presented as undercurrents:
  - Security  
  - Data management  
  - DataOps  
  - Data architecture  
  - Orchestration  
  - Software engineering
- Undercurrents span the entire life cycle.

## Holistic Thinking
- Avoid jumping straight into implementation and tools.
- Focus on higher level goals and how to provide value.
- Think holistically about the data engineering life cycle and undercurrents to transform stakeholder needs into system requirements.

# A Brief History of Data Engineering — Video

## Data Everywhere
- Data comprises the building blocks of information.
- Data can be digitally recorded and stored or transmitted.

## Beginning of Digital Data
- Digital data begins in the 1960s with the advent of computers.
- First computerized databases introduced.

## 1970s
- Relational databases emerged.
- SQL developed at IBM.

## 1980s
- Bill Inmon developed the first data warehouse for analytical decision making.

## 1990s
- Growth of data systems created the need for reporting and business intelligence.
- Ralph Kimball and Bill Inmon developed data modeling approaches for analytics.
- Internet went mainstream → rise of web-first companies.
- Emergence of backend systems: servers, databases, storage solutions.

## Early 2000s
- After the dotcom bust, companies like Yahoo, Google, and Amazon faced exploding data needs.
- Traditional relational databases and warehouses could not handle this scale.
- Beginning of the big data era.

## Big Data
- Defined by very large datasets analyzed computationally.
- Described by the three Vs: velocity, variety, volume.

## 2004 – MapReduce
- Google published MapReduce, an ultra-scalable data processing paradigm.
- Marked a major milestone in data technologies and the roots of modern data engineering.

## 2006 – Hadoop
- Yahoo engineers developed and open-sourced Apache Hadoop.
- Enabled large-scale data processing and storage.
- Era of the big data engineer began.

## Amazon’s Contributions
- Amazon developed EC2, S3, DynamoDB, and core scalable data building blocks.
- Offered these as AWS, the first popular public cloud.
- Developers could rent compute and storage instead of managing hardware.
- Other public clouds followed: Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure.
- Public cloud became a major innovation for data systems.

## Impact of Big Data Tools and Public Cloud
- Formed the foundation of today’s data ecosystem.
- Enabled small startups to access advanced data tools.

## Transition to Real-Time Data
- Shift from batch computing to event streaming.
- Enabled continuous processing of individual events.
- Era of big, real-time data.

## Decline of “Big Data” as a Term
- Managing early big data tools required heavy maintenance and large engineering teams.
- Companies spent excessive effort maintaining systems instead of delivering insights.
- Big data processing became accessible enough that the term became unnecessary.
- Big data engineers became simply data engineers.

## 2010s Onward
- Emergence of cloud-first, open source, and third-party products simplified working with data at scale.
- Data sources and formats continued to grow in variety and size.
- Data engineering became a discipline of interoperation and connecting technologies.

## Role of the Data Engineer Today
- Positioned further up the value chain.
- Ability to build powerful, scalable data systems using modern tools.
- Opportunity to contribute to future tools and technologies.
- Building robust data systems is central to business strategy.
- Data engineers directly support achieving business goals and delivering value.

## What Comes Next
- How data engineering fits with other roles and stakeholders.
- How to identify end users and their needs.
- How this relates to business value.
- How to translate stakeholder needs into system requirements.
